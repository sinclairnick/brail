- [**Brail Core**](https://www.brail.dev/docs/using/trpc): Tools for serving emails via type-safe APIs or SDKs
- [**Devtools**](https://www.brail.dev/docs/crafting/devtools): Make email development, debugging and testing easier
- [**Linting**](https://www.brail.dev/docs/crafting/linting): Identify and fix common HTML email pitfalls

## Features

## Why would I want to use Brail?

Handwriting emails using HTML is notoriously a pain. Unlike the web, email clients don't strongly adhere to a specific standard, resulting in limited and inconsistent support for CSS and HTML features.

Consequently, HTML emails become incredibly verbose, complex and littered with Microsoft Outlook-specific HTML comments, heavily nested `<table>` elements and esoteric CSS properties. As such, handwriting HTML email is an uncommon and tedious artform.

Brail abstracts away that complexity and aims to provide a web-like experience to writing emails, making it trivial to produce correct emails.

## Why not use a drag-and-drop editor?

Drag and drop editors make it easy to create email-safe templates, but lack many features we're used to in code-world like theming, abstraction, formatting, maths, version control, PRs and types. By providing a full-proof in-code solution to HTML emails, we regain the control, flexibility and power of code, which makes creating (and refactoring) emails much faster, easier and more fun.
