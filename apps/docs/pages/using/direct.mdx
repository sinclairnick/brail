# Calling Templates Directly

The simplest way to use a template is to simply call it's `render` method, which generates the email HTML, given the provided props.

```tsx
const html = myTemplate.render(props)
// Do something with HTML
```

If you've defined an `onSend` method, we can also send in a similarly simple fashion.

```tsx
await myTemplate.send({
	meta: { to: "larry@google.com" }
	data: props
})
```

### Express Example

To integrate these templates into an existing or custom API setup, we can just call them directly, as demonstrated below.

```tsx
// express-example.ts
const app = express()

app.get("/my-template", (req) =>{
	return myTemplate.render(req.body)
})

app.post("/my-template", async (req) => {
	await myTemplate.send(req.body)
})
```

However, doing so for every template is tedious. Instead, we can use one of the utilities exported by Brail to expedite the process. See: [API](/using/api), [SDK](/using/sdk)

### Creating Local SDKs

If you wish to call the templates directly, including exposing them as a library, it's best to create a "local SDK".

```tsx
// ---| my-template-lib.ts |---
import { createSdk } from "brail/sdk";

// This can now be exported as a lib or used directly
export const email = createSdk(templates);

// ---| my-other-project.ts |---
const html = email.myTemplate.render({/** Props */*/})
```


> ğŸ’¡ `createSdk` is essentially an identity function that returns a more concise type definition, omitting noisy properties
