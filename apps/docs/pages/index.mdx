| ⚛️        | Using **simple, idiomatic React**, craft fully-fledged, responsive email templates in minutes   |
| 🧢        | Expose **end-to-end type-safe APIs and SDKs** so your templates always receive the correct data |
| 👀        | Preview templates in real-time using **live-reloading**                                         |
| **\{ \}** | Enjoy **git versioning**, **theming** and **abstraction**, unlike drag-and-drop editors         |

> Brail was inspired by and integrates with tools like [**tRPC**](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), [**NextJS**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) and [**Zod**](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

### Get started

The fastest way to get up and running locally, is to use the [**Nextjs + Trpc Starter**](https://github.com/sinclairnick/brail/tree/main/packages/starters/nextjs-trpc-starter) project. More starters will be gradually added to the `packages/starters` folder as the Brail API stabilises.

```bash
npx degit sinclairnick/brail/starters/nextjs-trpc-starter
```

### Development status

> 🚦 Brail is currently in Beta. It has been used in production for a year, but the API is still subject to change.
