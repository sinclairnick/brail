# Welcome to Brail

### 💌 The email development toolkit for the 21st century

Brail provides batteries-included tooling for creating, generating and delivering email templates. It aims to bring email development into the 21st century by providing a modern, developer-friendly experience.

```bash
# Add brail to your favourite React meta-framework
npm install brail @brail/react
```

**Brail is a toolkit, not a framework.**

It works best with React meta-frameworks that provide API routes, like next.js, which allow us to develop and preview templates; and run server-side code at the same time.

> Brail was inspired by and integrates with tools like [**tRPC**](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), [**NextJS**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) and [**Zod**](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

> 🔔 While Brail is fundamentally framework agnostic, it is currently designed with next.js in mind. The examples in these docs are currently tailored to next.js, but not necessarily exclusive to next.js.

### Get started

The fastest way to get up and running locally, is to use the [**Nextjs + Trpc Starter**](https://github.com/sinclairnick/brail/tree/main/packages/starters/nextjs-trpc-starter) project. More starters will be gradually added to the `packages/starters` folder as the Brail API stabilises.

```bash
npx degit sinclairnick/brail/starters/nextjs-trpc-starter
```


### Development status

> 🚦 Brail is currently in Beta. It has been used in production for a year, but the API is still subject to change.
