# Welcome to Brail

### ðŸ’Œ The email development toolkit for the 21st century

Brail provides batteries-included tooling for creating, generating and delivering html emails. With out-of-the-box email template correctness, ergonomic React templating and full-stack type-safety, never send an erroneous transactional (or marketing) email again.

### Get started

The fastest way to get up and running locally, is to use the Nextjs-Trpc-Starter project. More starters will be added gradually.


```bash
npx degit sinclairnick/brail/starters/nextjs-trpc-starter
```
