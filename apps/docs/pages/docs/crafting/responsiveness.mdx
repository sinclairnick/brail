# Responsiveness

Today, more emails are viewed on mobile devices than on desktop devices [[1]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats#mobile). This means creating responsive email templates is very important. But it also complicated the underlying HTML. As the spritual successor to [MJML](https://mjml.io/) – the original responsive HTML email framework – Brail React has responsiveness baked into it from the ground up. By default, the React components provided by Brail are responsive, but this behaviour can also be modified to suit your needs.
