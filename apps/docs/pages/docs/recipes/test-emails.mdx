# Sending test emails

Assuming you've set up the [Devtools](/docs/crafting/devtools) and an `onSend` function for your template, you can easily send test emails. However, you might notice local images aren't appearing in the emails.

During local development, the images aren't yet hosted anywhere, so references to local files won't work for remote readers. To fix this, we can use `ngrok` to tunnel through to our local environment so our local images appear in any test emails we might send.

### 1. Setup `ngrok`

```bash
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

You'll need to create a (free) account if you havent' already, and set up authentication:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
```

Then we can tunnel our local dev environment through `ngrok`:

### 2. Tunnel through `ngrok`
```bash
ngrok http 3000 # Assuming you're running on port 3000
```

While `ngrok` is tunneling it should show us a URL that represents our forwarded port. Something like.


```
...
Forwarding		 https://XXXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXXXX.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
...				 ^ Copy this URL
```

### 3. Set Brail `baseUrl`

We should also set our image urls to use the `baseUrl` produced in the `ngrok` output.

```tsx
<Email baseUrl={urlFromNgrok}>
	{/* ...*/}
</Email>
```

--- 
âœ… **Done**. Your images will now work in test emails.
