# Introduction

Using drag-and-drop email editors leaves a lot to be desired, from a developers perspective. On the other hand, manually writing HTML templates is error-prone, complicated and lacks an ecosystem that gets you up and running in production.

Brail makes it easy to create **responsive email templates** and **actually use them**.

## Brail is a Full-Stack Email Development Toolkit

Brail is a full-stack email development toolkit. It provides end-to-end type-safety so you never send incomplete dynamic data. Templates are responsive by default, so they'll look good on mobile.
