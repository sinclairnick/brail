# Crafting templates

Making it easy and fun to create email templates is a big part of what makes Brail great.

- The [**HTML Email Primer**](/crafting/html-emails) gives a crash course on how HTML email ticks. While not strictly necessary, it can help to understand how some of the design decisions for Brail were made.

- Under [**Email Templates**](/crafting/templates), you'll get a better look at how to use the Brail components effectively and which components exist.

- When you're ready to jazz things up, [**Theming**](/crafting/theming) describes how to use Brail themes to deliver consistent emails and make sweeping changes trivially.

- Building templates is fine, but with the Brail [**Devtools**](/crafting/devtools), sending test emails and previewing templates across viewports is a breeze.

- Read the [**Linting**](/crafting/linting) section to learn about ensuring your templates are always up to scratch, especially when going off-piste.

- What about images and files? See [**static files**](/crafting/static-files)
